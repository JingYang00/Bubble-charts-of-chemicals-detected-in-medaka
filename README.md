# Bubble-charts-of-chemicals-detected-in-medaka
The raw data included the amount of chemicals calculated by the machine, which I summarized and then used a t-test to find the difference between the control and experimental groups. I created three bubble charts based on gender and whether or not they were adults. It was quite interesting to make the bubble charts and I hope it helps someone.
I uploaded one of the bubble chart approaches, as well as the t.test file, since the other two are duplicate operations.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any ways to improve it or if you face any problems.
