# Bubble-charts-of-chemicals-detected-in-medaka
The raw data included the amount of chemicals calculated by the machine, which I summarized and then used a t-test to find the difference between the control and experimental groups. I created three bubble charts based on gender and whether or not they were adults. It was quite interesting to make the bubble charts and I hope it helps someone.
